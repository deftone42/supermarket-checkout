1 Supermarket Checkout

This problem is based around the pricing of goods in a supermarket and the various offers that can be applied to the pricing, for example:

1.1

A packet of biscuits costs £1.29 Cans of juice are 53p but if you buy 2 you get a 3rd free Microwave meals are £3.50 or 2 for £5

Representing prices

The first step is to define the model that you would use to represent the price, or cost, of each item that can be stocked by the supermarket. Try to bear in mind the following questions:

1.2

Are you representing price or cost How are savings defined Totaling a basket of items?
The second question is how this might be used in a checkout system to calculate the total cost of a basket that contains a combination of items priced like the examples above?. Bear in mind:

• Items can be scanned in any order
• Offers should always be applied if possible
• The supermarket owner would like to show the customer how much they saved

New types of pricing may need to be added in the future
